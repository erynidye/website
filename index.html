<h1>How to Survive With All Your Sanity, by erynidye</h1>
<p>Being alive is hard. So here's how to survive: <br> </p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Drink water</b>. Very important step, hydration or diedration.</li>
    <li><b>Eat food.</b> Also very important step, if you have food, eat it regularly.</li>
    <li><b>Get sleep.</b> Getting enough sleep is important, but personally, I think 1 hour is enough. Just enough to close your eyes, y'know. Definitely enough to not be sleep deprived the next day.</li>
    <li><b>Make daily sacrifices to the tree god. </b>Do this, or you will have disrespected the Great Tree God. Ritual circle ritual circle tree tree tree tree.</li>
    <li><b>Be kind to blahaj.</b> The BPS (Blahaj Protection Services) will be called on you. Do not the haj.</li>
</ul>
<p><br> MOST IMPORTANTLY: daily defenestration. Jump out a window.</p>
